%	OVERVIEW:
%       This basic demo will allow you to load an ECG file in matlab 
%       compatible wfdb format, detect the locations of the R peaks,
%       perform signal quality (SQI) analysis and plot the results.
%
%   OUTPUT:
%       A figure with the loaded ECG signal and detected peaks will be
%       generated

% The following parts of the code are added by Nasim Katebi on 09/12/2018 
%
%   OVERVIEW:
%       First part which is 'HRV using RR intervals' is for the detection 
%       of heart rate variability.
%       For this purpose heart rate will be estimated using a median of RR 
%       intervals in each segment (window)of signal.
%       In second part,'Line up the beats', beats of ecg will be aligned
%       based on detected QRS locations.
%       
% 
%   OUTPUT:
%         hr: vector of heart rate (bpm) size of vector is equal to
%         numberofbeats=round(length(ecg)/(WINDOW*Fs)) 
%         alignedbeat: This is a matrix for aligning the beats based on qrs
%         location

% calculating heart rate in each window of a signal.
WINDOW=10; %window size in second
for i=1:round(length(ecg)/(WINDOW*Fs))
    start=(i-1)*WINDOW*Fs+1;
    stop=i*WINDOW*Fs;
    r=r_peaks(r_peaks>start & r_peaks<stop); % finding r peaks in eachwindow
    hr{1,i}=60/(median(diff(sort(r/Fs)))); % heart rate (bpm) in each window using median of RR intervals
